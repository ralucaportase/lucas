    Extract data is used to extract data from pages with the help of xpaths
    Extract data is a list of objects!
    Every object needs to have:
    - The "type": "object"|"objects"
    - for objects you also need to add a selector which is used to select the
    objects and iterate over them
    - Data field which will be an object and can contain the values:
    - "key": "xpath" will set the key to the returned object with the value returned by xpath
    - "key": another object if we want to get lists as value, the object must contain
    - "type": "list" and a selector with the xpath to select the list values
    Example:
    [
        {
            "data": {
                "tags": {
                    "type": "list",
                        "selector": "div[@class='tags']/a[@class='tag']/text()"
                    },
                "text": "span[@class='text']/text()",
                "author": "span/small[@class='author']/text()"
            },
            "type": "objects",
            "selector": "//div[@class='quote']"
        },
        {
            "data": {
                "topTags": {
                    "type": "list",
                    "selector": "//div[contains(@class,'tags-box')]/span[@class='tag-item']/a[@class='tag']/text()"
                    }
            },
            "type": "object"
        }
    ]
</pre>
